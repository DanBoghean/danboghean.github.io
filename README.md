# Become a better me

This is an exploration in development. I've always wanted to do something like this. What is this?
It is an exploration where I get to experiment with different hobbies 30 days at a time. I pick
something I'm interested in and do that thing every day for 30 days straight. Things like:

- Photography
- Drawing
- Playing guitar
- Programming
- Designing logos
- Creating an app

The list is limitless really... I'm not really sure where I want to take this, but this is
the first step! My weakness is starting something and peetering out, but I'm really hoping
this takes and that I can use this as a platform to play around with different hobbies
and figure out what clicks. The idea is that as I do things for 30 days, I can fumble my way
to the things I really enjoy and start focusing on those things more intently. This is an experiment,
and it will be constantly evolving. But that's what makes it fun! Let's see where it goes!
