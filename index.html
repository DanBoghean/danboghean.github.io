    Become a better me This is an <b>exploration</b> in development. I've always
    wanted to do something like this. What is <i>this</i>? It is an exploration
    where I get to experiment with different hobbies 30 days at a time. I pick
    something I'm interested in and do that thing every day for 30 days
    straight. Things like:

    <ul>
      <li>Photography 📷</li>
      <li>Drawing ✍️</li>
      <li>Playing guitar 🎸</li>
      <li>Programming 💻</li>
      <li>Designing logos 👨‍💻</li>
      <li>Creating an app 📲</li>
    </ul>

    The list is <b>limitless</b> really... I'm not really sure where I want to
    take this, but this is the first step! My weakness is starting something and
    peetering out, but I'm really hoping this takes and that I can use this as a
    platform to play around with different hobbies and figure out what clicks.
    The idea is that as I do things for 30 days, I can fumble my way to the
    things I really enjoy and start focusing on those things more intently. I'm
    keeping things extremely simple and using the tools that are best for the
    job to reduce mental overhead and make sure that I don't give up because I
    have too much to do. The focus is only on the task at hand. This is an
    experiment, and it will be constantly evolving. But that's what makes it
    fun! Let's see where it goes!
